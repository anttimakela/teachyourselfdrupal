When we visit the home page of our site, we see that there is no front page content.
In fact, there is no content at all.
We can verify that by clicking the Find content link in the shortcuts.

Let's add our content now.
We can click Add content in either the shortcut menu or in the Action links area.

For this simple site we will be using only the Basic Page content type.
We will be creating a total of six pages.
Let's create the front page first.

Click on the Basic page link.

The title field is required for all pieces of content.
You can tell that it is a required field because it has an asterisk next to it.
The Body field is optional. We will be placing text in the body for all of our pages.

To make things easy, I will use the information provided in the Github repo.

I'm going to open a new browser tab and navigate to https://github.com/teachyourselfdrupal.
Click on the teachyourselfdrupal repository.
Click on content-of-basic-pages

Select the Title for the first page and paste it into the Title textfield.

Right now, don't worry about the "Edit summary link."
Just copy and paste the Body text for Page 1.

You may leave the Text format set to Filtered HTML.

Check the box to provide a menu link.

Scroll down and Save the page.

We will follow this same process for the remaining five pages.

To begin creating the second page, you may either click the Add content link in the Navigation block or you may click it in the shortcut menu.
Remember that we will use the Basic page content type for all of our pages for this site.

After you have entered all the pages, visit the Home page.
Well, it seems that we still have to do a bit more configuration. See you in the next video!
